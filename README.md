# struts2-springboot-migration 

## This repo outlines the steps needed to migrate a Struts2 Application to Spring Boot, in two ways.
* With Struts.xml configuration and Spring Boot configuration.
* With completely annotation driven Struts Configuration and Spring Boot

The original Struts2 example (which has been migrated in this repo) is located here: https://github.com/apache/struts-examples/tree/master/annotations
